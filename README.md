# CC-HIC Data Specification Version 2.0

This is a comprehensive data specification for CC-HIC designed to facilitate the ETL to OMOP (OHDSI Version 6 CDM). We follow the same conventions as detailed on the OHDSI Common Data Model wiki.

The founding axioms to follow when performing your ETL are:
- If something happens, we must know about it and have a record.
- If there is no record, it must follow that nothing happened.
